def beholder(i=3):
    '''
    The beholder() function takes in the number of "Eye Ray" actions that the beholder will take during a given turn (3 for a regular action, 1 for a legendary action).\n
    
    Bugs:\n
    1. Repeat rolls are still possible results with this function. This needs to be removed.
    2. The formatting is still cumbersome and I would like to draw it down so it's cleaner and easier for a DM to read.
