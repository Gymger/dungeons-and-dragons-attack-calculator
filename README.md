# dungeons-and-dragons-attack-calculator
  This is a project I'm using to develop my python programming skills.  The primary purpose of these functions is to make it easier to simulate Dungeons and Dragons (5th Edition) battles based on the many variables present in the rulebooks.  There's a lot of information to parse through, so there's plenty of material to shape this practice project.
