# dungeons-and-dragons-attack-calculator
  Everything within this project is intended to fit to the Dungeons and Dragons 5e rules. I'm pretty basic in both my python familiarity as well as my github familiarity, so if anything gives the impression I don't know what I'm doing, there's a very realistic likelihood that's the case.
